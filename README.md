More Jupyter notebooks will be added during this term. Therefore, repo updates must be repeatedly pulled in order to stay up to date. 

# Jupyterbook
The static html book is in subdirectory [objectrecogniton/_build/html/](objectrecogniton/_build/html/). Start reading the book with [objectrecogniton/_build/html/intro.html](objectrecogniton/_build/html/intro.html) (on your local file system).

Like the jupyter notebooks itself, also the jupyter-book will be extended throughout the term. Repeatedly pull the repo to stay up to date.
